# DIGIKULL assignment-08

Problem Statement 1

Implement a function, findFirstUnique(arr), which takes an array as input and returns the first unique integer in the array.

Note: The function should return null if no unique number is found.

Input #

An array of integers

Output #

The first unique element in the array

Sample Input #
                            [9,2,3,2,6,6]

                 Sample Output #

                              9
